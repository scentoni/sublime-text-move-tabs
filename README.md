Move Tabs
=========

Moves tabs in Sublime Text, like in Google Chrome.


Keybindings
-----------

The default keybindings are:

*Ctrl+Shift+Page Up/Down* for moving tabs left/right.  
*Ctrl+Shift+Home/End* for moving tabs to the beginning/end.

For small Mac keyboards, use Fn+Ctrl+Shift and the arrow keys:

*Fn+Ctrl+Shift+Up/Down* for moving tabs left/right.  
*Fn+Ctrl+Shift+Left/Right* for moving tabs to the beginning/end.
